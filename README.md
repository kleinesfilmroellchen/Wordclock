# Wordclock

An artistic clock. The clock uses different fixed pieces of text which it selectively "lights" up to create a sentence describing the current time.
Currently the "sentence" and clock words are in German only, because there are a lot more ways to express time than in English :-), and the
spacing needed to be adjusted for every single word to look nice. I might do a separate English version at some point.

Inspired by a real world clock using the exact same technique but real lighing behind a black glass pane with letter gaps.

Suggested to @TheCodingTrain as a coding challenge.
